<h2>Key findings</h2>
<p>From 2018 to 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li>533 cyclists and 708 pedestrians suffered casualties on Bradford’s roads</li>
<li>74% of the pedestrians were more than 50 metres from a pedestrian crossing</li>
<li>85% of pedestrian casualties involved a car</li>
<li>44% of cyclist casualties involved a car</li>
<li>91% of the cyclists were male</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="with-more-time" class="slide level2 smaller">
<h2>With more time…</h2>
<ul>
<li>Investigate more of the variables to develop a better understanding of what they are describing for further analysis</li>
<li>Make a dashboard with filters to link data points on maps with summary tables for better insights</li>
<li>Investigate sex-based differences in casualties, particularly cyclists</li>
<li>Investigate demographics of car drivers for each casualty type</li>
<li>Explore the relationship between slight, serious and fatal casualties</li>
<li>Environmental (e.g., time of day) factors behind each category of casualty</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="concluding-thoughts" class="slide level2 smaller">
<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>Cars are involved in the majority of casualties involving pedestrians and cyclists</p>
<p>Walking and cycling may help prevent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
</ul>
<p>Improve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mental health</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less polluting</li>
<li>Quieter</li>
